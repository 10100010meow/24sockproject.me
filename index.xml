      <description>The first pair of socks have been completed. I cast on the first one on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, and started the second one on January 5. The texture sort of got lost in the print nature of the yarn, so I may revisit this pattern again later on a plain yarn. I would have gone for a single-colour yarn this time, but the only ones I have on hand are lighter, and I have to go down a needle size and up to a 72 stitch sock to not get laddering.</description>

      <description>I cast on these socks on the night of December 1. I wanted to see just how long it would take me to knit a pair of vanilla socks, to see how realistic this project actually is (for me, I know for some people twenty-four socks in twelve months is no stretch at all). This was certainly the fastest that I&amp;rsquo;ve knit a pair, it was less than two weeks in total, and I had a couple of evenings with no knitting at all in there.</description>

      <description>By day, I&amp;rsquo;m an entrepreneur, software developer, and electronics designer. By night, I&amp;rsquo;m a woodworker, knitter, and crocheter.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been knitting since October 2016 (and crocheting since June 2016), and have knit six pairs of socks before starting this project.
The goal of this site it to document my progress (and keep me honest) on knitting twenty-four socks (ideally twelve pairs) in 2018.</description>

      <description>These are the rules that I&amp;rsquo;ve laid out for myself for the project so far. These are subject to change, but I suspect I&amp;rsquo;ll only make them more restrictive, not less.
 All socks need to be sized for an adult foot (baby and child socks do not count). All socks must be started and completed in the project timeframe. For a sock to be &amp;ldquo;completed&amp;rdquo; it needs to be bound off with all ends woven in.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this site is to document the progress of my 2018 goal to knit twelve pairs of socks (thus the 24 socks). I&amp;rsquo;ve been knitting since October 2016 (and crocheting since June 2016), and have knit six pairs of socks.
In preparation for the project, I have picked up Socktacular and Artful Arches from Knit Picks and enough yarn for five pairs of socks.</description>
