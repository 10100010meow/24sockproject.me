I took a quick break from socks (as I'm currently ahead of schedule with three of twenty-four socks complete) to crochet my son a [bearded hat](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bobble-bearded-beanie) for his birthday. It was a really quick project; if I didn't have to rip it out several times to get the fit right, it would have been finished in two evenings. It was my first time doing the 'bobble stitch' for the beard--they're also not difficult, but they do slow things down a bit.
