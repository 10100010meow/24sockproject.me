I cast on these socks on the night of December 1. I wanted to see just how long it would take me to knit a pair of vanilla socks, to see how realistic this project actually is (for me, I know for some people twenty-four socks in twelve months is no stretch at all). This was certainly the fastest that I've knit a pair, it was less than two weeks in total, and I had a couple of evenings with no knitting at all in there. Overall I'm pretty happy with these socks, but I think for my next pair, I'll increase the leg length a little bit.
