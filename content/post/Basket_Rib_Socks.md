The first pair of socks have been completed. I cast on the first one on New Year's Day, and started the second one on January 5. The texture sort of got lost in the print nature of the yarn, so I may revisit this pattern again later on a plain yarn. I would have gone for a single-colour yarn this time, but the only ones I have on hand are lighter, and I have to go down a needle size and up to a 72 stitch sock to not get laddering.
