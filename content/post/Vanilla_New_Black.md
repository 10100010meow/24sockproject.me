This is pair number four complete, and less than two months in. I'm getting far enough ahead of pace that I might be able to take on some other projects and not let this one down. This was a new heel pattern for me, and I'm still not sure if I like it or not; I'll have to see how it fits, but I usually like a contrast heel (partially for looks, partially so that I don't run out of yarn) which this doesn't really allow for.
