The purpose of this site is to document the progress of my 2018 goal to knit twelve pairs of socks (thus the 24 socks). I've been knitting since October 2016 (and crocheting since June 2016), and have knit six pairs of socks.

In preperation for the project, I have picked up [Socktacular](http://www.knitpicks.com/Books/Socktacular!__D32674.html) and [Artful Arches](http://www.knitpicks.com/Books/Artful_Arches__D33233.html) from [Knit Picks](http://www.knitpicks.com/) and enough yarn for five pairs of socks.
