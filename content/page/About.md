By day, I'm an entrepreneur, software developer, and electronics designer. By night, I'm a woodworker, knitter, and crocheter.

I've been knitting since October 2016 (and crocheting since June 2016), and have knit six pairs of socks before starting this project.

The goal of this site it to document my progress (and keep me honest) on knitting twenty-four socks (ideally twelve pairs) in 2018.
