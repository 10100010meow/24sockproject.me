These are the rules that I've laid out for myself for the project so far. These are subject to change, but I suspect I'll only make them more restrictive, not less.

1.	All socks need to be sized for an adult foot (baby and child socks do not count).
2.	All socks must be started and completed in the project timeframe.
3.	For a sock to be "completed" it needs to be bound off with all ends woven in.
4.	If I rip the sock out, it doesn't count. Even if it was a sock at some point, when it's ripped out, it ceases to be a sock and reverts back to yarn.
5.	It's the '24 Sock Project' not the '12 Pairs of Socks Project' -- twenty-four individual socks count.
6.	The completed socks can be gifted to somebody else once completed; it doesn't necessarily have to be all selfish knitting (but it might be).
