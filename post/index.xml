      <description>The second pair have been completed. This uses up the last of the Drops Fabel that I have on hand. These knit up pretty quickly, especially after coming off a patterned pair.

      <title>Beard Hat</title>

      <description>I took a quick break from socks (as I&amp;rsquo;m currently ahead of schedule with three of twenty-four socks complete) to crochet my son a bearded hat for his birthday. It was a really quick project; if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to rip it out several times to get the fit right, it would have been finished in two evenings. It was my first time doing the &amp;lsquo;bobble stitch&amp;rsquo; for the beard&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re also not difficult, but they do slow things down a bit.</description>

      <description>The first pair of socks have been completed. I cast on the first one on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, and started the second one on January 5. The texture sort of got lost in the print nature of the yarn, so I may revisit this pattern again later on a plain yarn. I would have gone for a single-colour yarn this time, but the only ones I have on hand are lighter, and I have to go down a needle size and up to a 72 stitch sock to not get laddering.</description>

      <description>I cast on these socks on the night of December 1. I wanted to see just how long it would take me to knit a pair of vanilla socks, to see how realistic this project actually is (for me, I know for some people twenty-four socks in twelve months is no stretch at all). This was certainly the fastest that I&amp;rsquo;ve knit a pair, it was less than two weeks in total, and I had a couple of evenings with no knitting at all in there.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this site is to document the progress of my 2018 goal to knit twelve pairs of socks (thus the 24 socks). I&amp;rsquo;ve been knitting since October 2016 (and crocheting since June 2016), and have knit six pairs of socks.
In preparation for the project, I have picked up Socktacular and Artful Arches from Knit Picks and enough yarn for five pairs of socks.</description>
